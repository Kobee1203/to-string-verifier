## Getting Started

### Get To String Tester

Maven:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.jparams</groupId>
    <artifactId>to-string-tester</artifactId>

</dependency>
```

Gradle:
```
compile 'com.jparams:to-string-tester:1.x.x'
```

### What is To String Tester?
To String Tester is the easiest, most convenient way to test the toString method on your class. toString methods are incredibly important for logging and debugging purposes, yet when it comes to testing, it is often forgotten or ignored. It is very easy to add a new field to your class and forget to update the toString method. Without tests in place, you wonâ€™t know something is missing until you are sitting looking through logs or debugging your application and by that time its already too late.


### Write a Test
Writing a test is easy! In most cases you want to ensure that your toString method contains the class name and all the fields. Let's look at how we would write this test!

```java
@Test
public void testToString()
{
    ToStringTester.forClass(User.class)
                  .withClassName(NameStyle.SIMPLE_NAME)
                  .verify();
}
```

Oh! A user object. I would not want to include the password in the toString, how do I exclude it from my test? 

```java
@Test
public void testToString()
{
    ToStringTester.forClass(Person.class)
                  .withClassName(NameStyle.SIMPLE_NAME)
                  .withIgnoredFields("password")
                  .verify();
}
```

To String Tester is incredibly configurable, so take a look at the Java Docs for more options.
